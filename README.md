# easyPort
A novel approach of porting MultiPath TCP to Mobile Smart Devices

We conduct four experiments focusing on 1-path, 2-path, 3-path, and 4-path MPTCP scenarios respectively. In the four experiments, the file chrome.apk (64MB) are transmitted.

mptcp-test-nc-1-if.mp4 - use 1 sub-path to transfer data.

mptcp-test-nc-2-if.mp4 - use 2 sub-paths to transfer data.

mptcp-test-nc-3-if.mp4 - use 3 sub-paths to transfer data.

mptcp-test-nc-4-if.mp4 - use 4 sub-paths to transfer data.
